# Python-Calculator
Two simple python calculators in both PyQt and Tkinter

Python-Calculator is a package of two calculators, one programmed using Tkinter and the other programmed using PyQt. To use the calculator, press the buttons on screen to form an equation. Press "=" to solve the equation and display the output. Press 'C' to clear your equation and 'Quit' to quit the application. This calculator (v1) only supports the basic operations (+, -, ร, รท). An 'ERROR' message will be displayed if there is an invalid operation. You may also use your keyboard to interact with the calculator. Use the number keys to make your equation, and press either "=" or "RETURN" to solve the equation. Press 'C' to clear and 'Q' to quit. Both calculators function the same.
